# ADR-0001: Architecture Decision Record Template

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-02  
**Deciders:** Core Development Team  

## Context

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) help track important architectural decisions made during the development of QEM-Bench. This template provides a consistent format for documenting decisions, their context, and consequences.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records to document significant architectural decisions in the QEM-Bench project.

## Rationale

- **Transparency**: Makes architectural decisions visible to all contributors
- **Historical Context**: Preserves reasoning behind decisions for future reference
- **Collaboration**: Enables community discussion on architectural choices
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Helps new contributors understand system design
- **Decision Quality**: Forces structured thinking about trade-offs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better architectural documentation
- Improved decision-making process
- Enhanced team communication
- Easier onboarding for new contributors

### Negative
- Additional documentation overhead
- Need to maintain ADR discipline
- Potential for process bureaucracy

### Neutral
- Standard ADR format adopted across project
- ADRs stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Numbering scheme: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`

## Template Format
