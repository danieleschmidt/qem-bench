# QEM-Bench Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** QEM-Bench - Quantum Error Mitigation Benchmarking Suite  
**Project Type:** Open Source Research Framework  
**Start Date:** January 2025  
**Expected Duration:** Ongoing (Initial release Q1 2025)

## Problem Statement

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) research lacks standardized benchmarking tools and reproducible evaluation frameworks. Researchers struggle with:

- **Inconsistent Evaluation**: No standard benchmarks for comparing mitigation techniques
- **Platform Fragmentation**: Different implementations across quantum hardware platforms  
- **Reproducibility Crisis**: Results difficult to reproduce due to varying noise conditions
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Limited scalability for large-scale quantum simulations
- **Implementation Complexity**: High barrier to entry for new mitigation methods

## Project Scope
