# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The QEM-Bench team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the following process:

1. **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

2. Instead, please report them via email to security@qem-bench.org

3. Include the following information in your report:
   - Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
   - The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

4. You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
4. Release new security fix versions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update QEM-Bench and its dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade qem-bench
   ```

2. **Secure API Keys**: Never commit API keys or credentials to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
   - Use `.env` files with proper `.gitignore` entries
   - Consider using secret management services

3. **Network Security**: When using cloud backends
   - Always use TLS/HTTPS connections
   - Verify SSL certificates
   - Use VPN when accessing sensitive quantum hardware

4. **Access Control**: Implement proper access controls
   - Use role-based access for shared resources
   - Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
   - Monitor access logs for unusual activity

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes must be reviewed before merging
   - Security-sensitive changes require additional review
   - Use automated security scanning tools
   - Check for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities
   - Pin dependency versions for reproducibility

3. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
   - Circuit definitions
   - Configuration parameters
   - File paths and URLs
   - User-provided data

4. **Error Handling**: Implement secure error handling
   - Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
   - Log security events appropriately
   - Fail securely (deny by default)

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

QEM-Bench includes several security features:

1. **Input Validation**: All circuit inputs are validated before execution
2. **Sandboxed Execution**: Simulations run in isolated environments
3. **Rate Limiting**: API calls to quantum backends are rate-limited
4. **Audit Logging**: Security-relevant events are logged
5. **Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit

### Configuration Security

```python
# Example secure configuration
from qem_bench import SecureConfig

config = SecureConfig()
config.load_from_env()  # Load from environment variables
config.validate()        # Validate configuration
```

## Known Security Considerations

### Quantum-Specific Risks

1. **Quantum Data Privacy**: Quantum states may contain sensitive information
   - Use quantum encryption where appropriate
   - Be aware of quantum no-cloning theorem implications

2. **Hardware Access**: Direct quantum hardware access requires special care
   - Use hardware provider's security best practices
   - Monitor quantum resource usage
   - Implement proper access controls

3. **Noise Injection Attacks**: Malicious noise models could affect results
   - Validate noise model parameters
   - Use trusted noise characterization sources

## Security Tools

We recommend using the following tools:

```bash
# Python security scanning
pip install pip-audit safety bandit

# Check for vulnerabilities
pip-audit
safety check
bandit -r src/

# Static analysis
mypy src/
pylint src/

# Dependency updates
pip list --outdated
```

## Compliance

QEM-Bench aims to comply with relevant security standards:

- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as:
- **Critical**: Immediate patch release
- **High**: Within 30 days
- **Medium**: Within 90 days
- **Low**: Next regular release
