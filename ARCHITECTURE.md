# QEM-Bench Architecture

## Overview

QEM-Bench is designed as a modular framework for quantum error mitigation research and benchmarking. The architecture follows clean separation of concerns with clear interfaces between components.

## Core Components

### 1. Mitigation Techniques (`qem_bench.mitigation`)

- **Zero-Noise Extrapolation (ZNE)**: Noise scaling and extrapolation methods
- **Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC)**: Quasi-probability decomposition 
- **Virtual Distillation (VD)**: Multi-copy purification protocols
- **Clifford Data Regression (CDR)**: Learning-based error correction

### 2. Benchmarking Suite (`qem_bench.benchmarks`)

- **Circuits**: Standard benchmark circuit generators
- **Metrics**: Fidelity, trace distance, and custom evaluation metrics
- **Leaderboards**: Standardized result tracking and comparison

### 3. Noise Modeling (`qem_bench.noise`)  

- **Models**: Device noise characterization and simulation
- **Characterization**: Automated device profiling tools
- **Replay**: Record and replay real device noise patterns

### 4. Backend Integration (`qem_bench.backends`)

- **Simulators**: JAX-accelerated quantum simulation
- **Hardware**: Direct interfaces to quantum devices  
- **Converters**: Circuit format translation utilities

## Design Principles

### Modularity
Each component can be used independently or composed together. Clear interfaces enable easy extension and customization.

### Performance  
JAX integration provides GPU/TPU acceleration for large-scale simulations and gradient-based optimization.

### Reproducibility
Noise replay system and deterministic benchmarks ensure reproducible research results.

### Extensibility
Plugin architecture allows easy addition of new mitigation methods and benchmark circuits.

## Data Flow
